# Steveflyer's Gembox

This is a python-based toolbox for myself. And this repo is also a 
required package for my other projects, such as:

- [zephyrion](https://github.com/stevieflyer/zephirion): a pyppeteer-based headless web automation tool
- [cetino](https://github.com/stevieflyer/cetino): a lightweight and pythonic database manipulation tool in python

This repo include all kinds of tools I need in my daily work, including:
- [x] [**`io_utils`**]
- [x] [**`debug_utils`**]

etc...

I hope you guys can find your hammers here :)
